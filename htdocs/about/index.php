	<p>
		I am committed to supporting women along this most powerful journey. 
		My mission is to help women <em>discover and develop their own confidence and 
		ability to give birth and enter motherhood</em>, as they define it. In addition, 
		I offer <a href="/breastfeeding/">breastfeeding education/support</a> and 
		<a href="/placenta_encapsulation/">placenta encapsulation services</a> 
		to new mothers and moms-to-be.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also teach the 
		<a href="http://www.seacoastbirthmatters.com/sbm/prenatal/breastfeeding-basics/">Breastfeeding Basics class at Seacoast Birth Matters</a> 
		in Kittery, Maine. This class runs monthly. Check online for upcoming dates and to register.
	</p>
	
		
	<p>
		I grew up in the Berkshires of Massachusetts and hold a BA in Psychology 
		and a Masters of Social Work degree from Simmons College in Boston. 
		Since 2007 I've been working in the Seacoast community as a birth doula. 
		From a very early age, I was drawn to all things pregnancy and childbirth 
		and have a strong reverence for this sacred time.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Now living in Eliot, Maine with my husband and two children, I am certified as 
		a birth doula through <a href="http://www.dona.org/">DONA (Doulas of North America)</a>. 
		In October 2011, I became a Certified Lactation Counselor (CLC) through the 
		<a href="http://www.talpp.org/">Academy of Lactation Policy and Practice</a> and 
		<a href="http://www.healthychildren.cc/">Healthy Children’s Center for Breastfeeding</a>. 
		I strive to gently guide moms and babies toward establishing a positive 
		breastfeeding relationship from the start. In 2012 I was trained as a 
		Placenta Encapsulation Specialist by Placenta Benefits and I'm happy to offer 
		this service to any new mom within my service area.

			As an MSW, I understand the importance of authentic connection and support 
			of women (and their partners) during this major life transition. 
			I've combined my areas of interest: supporting women psychologically AND 
			the childbearing year - to create my ideal practice.

	<p>
		My two girls were born at <a href="http://www.beverlyhospital.org/locations--services/health-services/maternity,-obstetrics/north-shore-birth-center">The North Shore Birth Center</a> 
		on the campus of Beverly Hospital in Beverly, MA. Chloe in 2002 and Charlotte in 
		2005 (a water birth).  My husband and I took the <a href="http://www.bradleybirth.com/">Bradley Method</a> 
		of Natural Childbirth classes and it was there that my appreciation for the 
		birth process grew to an even deeper level. Finding the experience of 
		birthing my own babies to be such a special time, I'm honored to work 
		with other women to as they prepare for this profound event.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		I have great respect for the physiological and emotional processes of birth and 
		strongly believe in the amazing ability of a woman’s body to birth her baby. At 
		the same time, understanding that every birth is different and there is not "one" 
		way to have a baby. <strong>The more you know and understand the birth process, the 
		less fearful you are</strong>, the more trust you have in your body and the more 
		empowering birth will become.

	<p>
		By educating clients about their many choices in childbirth, I work to guide 
		women and couples safely through their own unique childbirth experience – 
		respecting the decisions they make. Being invited to attend a birth is an 
		honor unlike any other and I truly thank my clients for allowing me to share 
		in such an intimate experience
	</p>
	
	<blockquote class="callout full">
		<p>
			My personality is laid back and down to earth yet professional. I believe that 
			I bring a sense of humor to my work when appropriate, which can often add a 
			feeling of relief to the setting. And as Ina May Gaskin says, laughing helps 
			the labor process along!
