	<h1>Natural Labor Companion</h1>
	
	<p>
		Here is a CD called Natural Labor Companion that I recommend for practicing 
		relaxation and visualization. It can be used during labor, as well in 
		pregnancy to get into the habit of filling your mind with positive thoughts 
		and training your body to get into the habit of relaxing.
