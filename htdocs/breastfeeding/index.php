	<h1>Breastfeeding Support</h1>

	<p>
		Planning to breastfeed? I offer lactation support to help you achieve 
		your breastfeeding goals.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I'm available for consultations, additional follow-up visits or a more structured schedule of support. 
		Another option is a more in-depth <strong>Breastfeeding Basics</strong> class, in the privacy of your own home. 
	</p>

		<p>
			In addition, I teach the 
			<a href="http://www.seacoastbirthmatters.com/sbm/prenatal/breastfeeding-basics/">Breastfeeding Basics class at Seacoast Birth Matters</a> 
			in Kittery, Maine. This class runs monthly. Check online for upcoming dates and to register.

			Lactation support is included in all birth doula packages, but is also offered independently.

	</p>
	
	<p>
		Most parents are so excited and focused on the actual event – the birth – of their baby (and rightly so!) 
		that they sometimes forget to focus on learning about breastfeeding.

	<p>
		Investing in some prenatal education and preparation is an important part of preparing to care 
		for your baby. Although breastfeeding IS a natural process, it doesn't always come 
		"naturally" without some instruction and education. As with anything, knowledge 
		and practice makes a big difference.  
	</p>

	<p>
		As a Certified Lactation Counselor (CLC), I am able to gently guide moms and babies 
		towards establishing a positive breastfeeding relationship from the start. 
		Early support, both prenatally and during those first few days/weeks can be essential 
		to preventing problems and finding solutions. Knowing what to expect after your baby is 
		here, will prove valuable to your breastfeeding success. For example, helping baby 
		find the correct and comfortable latch prevents many common issues, such as nipple pain. 
	</p>


	<p>
		<em>Breastfeeding should not be painful! If it is, get help early.</em>
	</p>

		In October 2011, I became a Certified Lactation Counselor (CLC) through the 
		<a href="http://www.talpp.org/">Academy of Lactation Policy and Practice</a> and 
		<a href="http://www.healthychildren.cc/">Healthy Children’s Center for Breastfeeding</a>.

	<h2>What is a CLC</h2>	
	
	<p>
		The Certified Lactation Counselor (CLC) certification means that I have received training and 
		competency verification in breastfeeding and human lactation support including:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>helping a baby latch on</li>
		<li>counseling mothers</li>
		<li>knowledge of milk production</li>
		<li>practical feeding</li>
		<li>special circumstances</li>
		<li>feeding difficulties</li>
		<li>prevention and management of sore nipples</li>
		<li>breastfeeding and returning to work or school</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		All of this gives the CLC a strong foundation with which to help moms and babies.
