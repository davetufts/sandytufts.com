	<h1>Placenta Encapsulation Services</h1>
		
	<p>
		Placenta encapsulation is the process of taking your own amazing and 
		nutrient rich placenta and turning it into capsule form for new mothers 
		to ingest during the postpartum period.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		I provide placenta encapsulation services in Southern Maine, 
		Seacoast New Hampshire, and North Shore Massachusetts.
	</p>
	
	<p>

	</p>
	
	<p>
		The placenta is prepared in the Traditional Chinese Medicine method  
		by steaming, dehydrating, grinding into a powder - then placing the powder 
		into easily swallowed capsules.The capsules can be taken daily for a number 
		of weeks, yielding anywhere from 75-200 pills, depending on the size of 
		your placenta.
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>
			Strict OSHA guidelines for food safety and cleanliness are used in 
			the preparation process.
		</em>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Benefits of Placenta Encapsulation</h2>
	
	<p>
		For years, Traditional Chinese Medicine has used the placenta to <strong>treat 
		fatigue and increase milk supply</strong>. Although the idea may seem 
		very strange to our culture, more and more women are now taking 
		advantage of the benefits the placenta has to offer.
	</p>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Experts agree that the placenta retains hormones. Reintroducing them to 
			your system is believed to stabilize postpartum hormonal fluctuations, 
			which can be related to the baby blues and postpartum depression.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>
		The placenta has been shown to contain high levels of iron, vitamins 
		and your own natural hormones, which can help to:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>balance your system</li>
		<li>decrease occurrence of baby blues/postpartum depression</li>
		<li>increase energy</li>
		<li>enhance milk supply</li>
		<li>lessen bleeding</li>
		<li>allow for an easier postpartum adjustment</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Encapsulation Process</h2>
	
	
	<p>
		The whole encapsulation process takes place in your home. 
		It's completed over 2 visits, each visit lasting 1-2 hours.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Day one</strong>, the placenta is steamed and the dehydration 
			process begins.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Day two</strong>, I return to your home to grind and encapsulate. 
			I bring all of my own supplies/equipment and clean up afterwards. 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		You receive a jar full of capsules, full dosage instructions, as well 
		as a satin pouch containing a heart-shaped umbilical cord dehydrated keepsake.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Fees &amp; Contract</h2> 
	
	<p>
		<strong>The fee for encapsulation services is $250.</strong> Payment 
		is due on the 2nd day when the pills are completed.
