			<li>Embracing my client as we work through a contraction together.</li>
		</ul>
	</blockquote>

	<ul>
		<li>Two Prenatal Visits</li>
		<li>Unlimited 24/7 phone and email support throughout pregnancy</li>
		<li>On-call from two weeks before your due date until the birth</li>
		<li><strong>Continuous support</strong> during labor and birth</li>
		<li>2+ postpartum visits as needed to offer lactation support if you plan on breastfeeding.</li>
		<li>A written time-line of your birth</li>
		<li><strong>Photography of labor and birth</strong>, along with an album containing your photos to help preserve the memory of your special day.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		<em>
			<a href="/breastfeeding/">Lactation support</a> is included in all birth doula packages, but is also 
			offered independently.

	</p>
	
	<p>
		For more detailed information about my services and role as your doula, 
		<a href="/contact/">contact me</a> to request my contract.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Third Party Reimbursement</strong> – To help with the possibility of 
		getting reimbursed by your insurance company, I can provide you with an 
		invoice for my services along with materials and instructions on how to 
		submit the claim. It takes a little effort but it’s worth trying!
	</p>
		
	<p>
		<strong>Backup Support</strong> – I work closely with 3 other experienced 
		birth doulas, whom I love and trust. We provide back-up support for one 
		another. So if by chance I was ill or attending another birth, one of 
		these wonderful doulas could come to support you during your birth. It 
		doesn't happen often, but it's a great security to have in place. My backup 
		team includes 
		<a href="http://www.bbdoula.com">Beth Brown</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.seacoastfamilyhealthservices.com/">Stacy Swain</a>, and 
		<a href="http://www.houndhill.com">Amy Peterson</a>.

	<h2>What Does a Birth Doula Do?</h2>
	<p>
		A birth doula recognizes birth as a key life experience that the mother 
		will remember all her life.
	</p>
	<p>
		We understand the physiology of birth and the emotional needs of a woman in labor.
		We assist the couple in planning and carrying out their birth plans.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			The acceptance of doulas in maternity care is growing rapidly with 
			the recognition of their important contribution to the improved 
			physical outcomes and emotional well being of mothers and infants.<br />
			<a href="/resources/">More resources and information…</a>
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		A birth doula stays by the side of the laboring woman throughout the 
		entire labor. We strive to protect the woman’s memory of her birth experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		During labor, birth doula provides…
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>emotional support</li>
		<li>physical comfort</li>
		<li>an objective viewpoint</li>
		<li>assistance to the woman in getting the information she needs to make good decisions.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<strong>
			A Doula does <em>not</em> speak for and make decisions for the couple 
			or perform any medical tasks.
		</strong>
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="doula_fees">Fees</h2>
	<p>
		My current fee is <strong>$900.00</strong>. A $300 deposit is due upon signing, 
		with the balance due at 38 weeks.

	<h2>What is a Doula</h2>
	<p>
		“Doula” is a Greek word meaning <em>caregiver</em>. It now refers to 
		a woman trained and experienced in childbirth who provides continuous 
		physical and emotional support to the laboring woman and her partner 
		before, during and just after childbirth.
